To fix this you can try two solutions. First, you can exclude files or directories (for example, /node_modules/) using 'exclude' option in loader configuration. Second, if you are using Babel, you can enable loose mode for `es6.modules` using the 'loose' option. See: http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-modules-commonjs/#options-loose and http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  return foundReactClasses;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = makeExportsHot;\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/.1.3.1@react-hot-loader/makeExportsHot.js\n ** module id = 521\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","function hasRender(Class) {\n  var prototype = Class.prototype;\n  if (!prototype) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  return typeof prototype.render === 'function';\n}\n\nfunction descendsFromReactComponent(Class, React) {\n  if (!React.Component) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  var Base = Object.getPrototypeOf(Class);\n  while (Base) {\n    if (Base === React.Component) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    Base = Object.getPrototypeOf(Base);\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n\nfunction isReactClassish(Class, React) {\n  if (typeof Class !== 'function') {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // React 0.13\n  if (hasRender(Class) || descendsFromReactComponent(Class, React)) {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  // React 0.12 and earlier\n  if (Class.type && hasRender(Class.type)) {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = isReactClassish;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/.1.3.1@react-hot-loader/isReactClassish.js\n ** module id = 522\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var isReactClassish = require('./isReactClassish');\n\nfunction isReactElementish(obj, React) {\n  if (!obj) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj.props) === '[object Object]' &&\n         isReactClassish(obj.type, React);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = isReactElementish;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/.1.3.1@react-hot-loader/isReactElementish.js\n ** module id = 523\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/"],"sourceRoot":""}
